# ZeroEC
**ZeroEC** is a training-free and explainable error correction system powered by large language models (LLMs). This repository contains the source code for the paper "ZeroEC: A Zero-Training Error Correction System with Large Language Models".
## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up the environment and get started with ZeroEC, follow these steps:

   ```
   # Create a new environment with Python 3.10
   conda create -n zeroec python=3.10
   conda activate zeroec

   # Install PyTorch with the specified version and CUDA toolkit
   conda install pytorch==1.13.1 cudatoolkit=11.7 -c pytorch -c conda-forge

   # Clone the ZeroEC repository
   git clone https://github.com/YangChen32768/ZeroC.git
   cd ZeroC

   # Install required dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Dataset

All the data used in this work can be found in `datasets` folder.

## Running ZeroEC

ZeroEC employs large language models (LLMs) for effective and explainable error correction. You can choose any LLM to run ZeroEC.

To run ZeroEC, specify the following parameters:

* `OPENAI_API_BASE`: the base URL of the LLM API (e.g., OpenAI API)
* `MODEL_NAME`: the name of the LLM model (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4o")

You can also use a local LLM by performing end-to-end calls to the LLM.

To correct errors in a dataset, provide the dirty dataset and the error detection results, and run:
```
python correction.py
```
