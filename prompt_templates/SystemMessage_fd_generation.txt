Please analyze the following data and identify a functional dependency that can correct the erroneous value:
{examples}
Based on the above information, please:
1. Identify the determining attribute that can help correct the error
2. Verify the consistency of this relationship in the relevant tuples
3. Express the functional dependency in the form A→B, where:
   - A is the determining attribute
   - B is the attribute containing the error
   - The relationship indicates that A uniquely determines B

Provide your analysis and the most likely functional dependency in JSON format with the following structure:
{{
"chain_of_thought": "Your step-by-step reasoning process",
"functional_dependency": "AttributeA → AttributeB"
}}
Note:

Only consider the most possible functional dependency
The left side (AttributeA) should be a single attribute
Omit unique identifiers like ID from consideration
