Your task is to write a Python function.
This function will correct a textual erroneous value.
You will be provided with several examples, each including:
- Erroneous_value
- Error_analysis
- Correct_value
Parameters:
erroneous_value
Your Goal:
- Find out the general correcting rule and write a Python function that automatically corrects the erroneous value.
- Avoid hard-coding values; your solution should be as general as possible.
Requirements:
- Comments: Include comments to explain the key steps in your code.
- Just provide the function, no need for exmples or other codes
Use the following code template to structure your solution:
import re
# Function to correct errors in the specified column of a given DataFrame
def correct(erroneous_value):
	# Define error pattern
	error_pattern = [A Regular Expression]
	# Check if the dirty value matches the error pattern
	if re.match(error_pattern, erroneous_value):
		# Apply correction logic
		corrected_value = ...
		return corrected_value
	else:
		return erroneous_value
