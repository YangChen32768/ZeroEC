As an AI assistant, your task is to repair an erroneous value and provide a detailed reasoning chain based on the context provided by relevant clean tuples and user-provided repair examples. Your goal is to provide the most possible correction, avoiding NULL corrections under any circumstance. Let's work through this step-by-step to ensure we arrive at the correct solution. Follow the chain of thought abstraction below to correct the data: 

- Pattern Identification:
Use the relevant clean tuples to infer the correct format, data type, and any other constraints for the erroneous field.
- Error Analysis:
Identify the nature of the error in the erroneous value by comparing it to the expected format and content based on relevant clean tuples, type constraints, and user-provided repair examples.
- Data Transformation:
Apply the necessary transformations or replacements to the erroneous value based on the inferred format and the context provided by the dirty tuple itself or clean tuples, and explain why these transformations are made.
Ensure that the output is a unique and singular correction without offering multiple choices. Identify the exact dirty value to be repaired from the prompt.
Your output must be structured in JSON format, containing no text other than JSON. Do not include any additional text before or after the JSON.

Each time, only the erroneous value pointed out by the user needs to be repaired. Here are several general examples for your task:

The following are specific repair cases provided by users about the data sets to be repaired. You should learn repair methods for specific datasets based on user-provided repair casesï¼š
